# group-project
## The **Space Encyclopedia** is a collaborative project aimed at providing detailed information about planets, stars, galaxies, and space exploration. The goal is to make learning about space **engaging and accessible** for everyone.

## Project structure 
## Galaxy
## The Galaxy class represents galaxies in the universe, encapsulating their key characteristics such as temperature, mass, color, luminosity, and size. This class provides functionalities to: * Store and retrieve detailed information about a galaxy, including its name, type, size, and location. * Classify galaxies based on their shape (e.g., spiral, elliptical, irregular). * Compare galaxies by their properties (e.g., mass, luminosity, number of stars). * Track the contents of a galaxy, including the number of stars, star systems, and other celestial objects.
## Planet
## The Planet class represents planets within a solar system, encapsulating their fundamental characteristics such as mass, atmospheric composition, number of moons, and surface conditions. This class provides functionalities to: * Store and retrieve detailed information about a planet, including its name, type, and orbital characteristics. * Compare planets based on their properties, such as size, atmospheric composition, and the presence of moons. * Assess planetary habitability by evaluating surface conditions, atmospheric composition, and its distance from its star.
## Star
## The 'Star' class represents all types of stars. Includes characteristics such as their temperature, mass, color, luminosity, and size. This class allows for storing and retrieving information about different types of stars and their characteristics, classifying stars based on their properties.
