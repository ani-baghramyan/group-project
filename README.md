## Project structure 
## Galaxy
## The Galaxy class represents galaxies in the universe, encapsulating their key characteristics such as temperature, mass, color, luminosity, and size. This class provides functionalities to: * Store and retrieve detailed information about a galaxy, including its name, type, size, and location. * Classify galaxies based on their shape (e.g., spiral, elliptical, irregular). * Compare galaxies by their properties (e.g., mass, luminosity, number of stars). * Track the contents of a galaxy, including the number of stars, star systems, and other celestial objects.
